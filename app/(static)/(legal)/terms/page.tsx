        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p>Effective date: 26/04/2024</p>

        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) constitute an agreement between
          Papermark (“Papermark,” “us,” “we” or “our”) and the party agreeing to
          these terms (“Customer,” “you,” or “your”). These Terms govern your
          access to and use of the Services. By accessing or using the Services,
          you accept these Terms, acknowledge that you have read and understand
          these Terms, and agree to be bound by these Terms. Please note that
          the Papermark Terms of Service, Papermark Business Agreement, the
          Papermark Privacy Policy, and any other terms found on the Papermark
          website do not apply to the Papermark Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are entering into these Terms for use of the Services by an
          organization, you are agreeing on behalf of that organization. You
          must have the authority to bind that organization to these terms,
          otherwise you must not sign up for the Services.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Provision</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms govern access to, and use of, the Services, and any
          associated Software, ordered by Customer through an Order Form.
          Customer may access and use the Services in accordance with the Terms.
        </p>
        <h3>1.2 Modifications</h3>
        <p>
          Papermark may update the Services from time to time. If Papermark
          changes the Services in a manner that materially reduces their
          functionality, Papermark will notify Customer at the email address
          associated with the account, and Customer may provide notice within
          thirty days of the change to terminate the Terms. This termination
          right will not apply to updates made to features provided on a beta or
          evaluation basis.
        </p>
        <h3>1.3 Software</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a. Generally.</strong> Some of the Services may allow Customer
          and End Users to download Software that may update automatically.
          Papermark hereby grants to Customer during the Term a limited
          non-exclusive license to use the Software solely in connection with
          the Services and in accordance with the Terms. This license is
          non-transferable (subject to Section 16.2), irrevocable (except as set
          forth in Section 8), non-sublicensable, and will be fully paid up upon
          Customer’s payment of the Fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b. Open Source.</strong> If any component of the Software is
          offered under an open source license, Papermark will make the license
          available to Customer and to the extent the provisions of that license
          grant Customer additional rights, those provisions will expressly
          override some provisions of the Terms solely with respect to that
          component of the Software.
        </p>
        <h3>1.4 Service-Specific Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Certain Services, or portions thereof, may be subject to additional
          terms, including third party terms and conditions, that are specific
          to the particular Services and are set forth in the Service-Specific
          Terms. By accessing or using Services covered by any Service-Specific
          Terms, you agree to the applicable Service-Specific Terms. If there is
          a conflict between these Terms and the Service-Specific Terms, the
          Service-Specific Terms will control with respect to the applicable
          Services or portions thereof. Your use of the Services may also be
          subject to additional policies, guidelines, or rules we post on the
          Services or make available to you.
        </p>
        <h3>1.5 Reference Materials</h3>
        <p>
          Papermark may make certain reference Materials, including without
          limitation an NDA, available through the Services. Such Materials are
          for informational purposes only and Papermark makes no representations
          or warranties as to their validity, reliability or sufficiency. The
          Materials, including the NDA, are not intended to (a) constitute legal
          advice or (b) create an attorney-client relationship. Customer
          acknowledges and agrees that each situation is highly fact-specific
          and requires a knowledge of both state and federal laws. Therefore any
          party should seek legal advice from a licensed attorney in the
          relevant jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <h3>1.6 Papermark Rights</h3>
        <p>
          Papermark reserves the right to access Customer’s account as necessary
          in order to provide the Services. Further, Customer agrees that we
          may, but are not required to: (a) monitor the Services or Customer
          Data for violations of these Terms and for compliance with our
          policies; (b) refuse, restrict access to or the availability of, or
          remove or disable access to the Materials or Customer Data or any
          portion thereof, without prior notice to Customer, at any time for any
          reason (including upon receipt of claims or allegations from third
          parties or authorities relating to Customer Data), or for no reason at
          all; (c) report to law enforcement authorities and/or take legal
          action against anyone who violates these Terms; or (d) manage the
          Services in a manner designed to protect our and third parties’ rights
          and property or to facilitate the proper functioning of the Service.
        </p>
        <h3>1.7 Third Party Services and Materials</h3>
        <p>
          The Services may contain links to Third Party Services and Third Party
          Materials. Papermark does not own, or operate these Third Party
          Services, and we do not endorse any Third Party Services or Third
          Party Materials. If Customer accesses or uses any Third Party Services
          or Third Party Materials: (a) Customer is solely responsible for this
          access and use; (b) Papermark is not responsible for any act or
          omission of the third party or the availability, accuracy, the related
          content, products or services of Third Party Services or Third Party
          Materials; and (c) these Terms do not apply to the Third Party
          Services. Before accessing or using a Third Party Service, you should
          review the Third Party Service’s terms and conditions, privacy policy,
          and all of Third Party Service’s other documents, and inform yourself
          of the terms, policies, and practices of the Third Party Service.

        <p>
          In order to use the Services, Customers and End Users must first
          register with us through our on-line registration process and
          authenticate following the authentication protocols provided by
          Customer. Account information must be accurate, current, and complete,
          and Customer agrees to keep this information up-to-date. Account
          information will be governed by Papermark Privacy Policy for the
          applicable Services.
        </p>
        <h3>2.2 End Users</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>a. Provisioning.</strong> Customer may provision End User
          Accounts up to the number of End User Licenses purchased through one
          or more Order Forms. Each End User Account requires a paid End User
          License, and End User Accounts may not be shared by multiple
          individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>b. Additional End Users.</strong> The Services may be
          configured to allow Administrators or End Users to purchase additional
          End User Licenses. Customer is responsible for understanding the
          settings and controls of the Services for purchasing End User Licenses
          and provisioning new End User Accounts. Papermark will charge Customer
          the applicable pro-rated amount for additional End User Licenses based
          on Customer’s then-current price unless otherwise set forth on the
          Order Form.
        </p>
        <h3>2.3 Customer Authentication</h3>
        <p>
          Customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the
          authentication methods they use to access the Services, including
          their Authentication Credentials. Customer and its End Users may not
          share the Authentication Credentials or, without Papermark’s
          permission, give others access to or transfer Customer’s account or
          any End User Account.
        </p>
        <h3>2.4 Unauthorized Use or Access</h3>

          Users and terminate any unauthorized use of or access to the Services.
          The Services are not intended for End Users under the age of 13 in the
          United States or 16 outside of the United States. Customer will ensure
          that it does not allow any person under 13 within the United States or
          16 outside the United States to use the Services. Customer is
          responsible for any activity using its account, whether or not
          Customer authorized that activity. You should immediately notify
          Papermark in writing of any unauthorized use of your account by

          engineer, reverse assemble or otherwise attempt to discover any source

        <h3>3.1 Limitations</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms constitute Customer’s instructions to Papermark to process

          restoring any Customer Data. Accordingly, Customer acknowledges that
          it bears sole responsibility for adequate backup and retention of

          secure encrypted connection to communicate with the Services if it
          wishes to protect transmission of data or files to Papermark.

        <h2>6. Pricing and Payment</h2>

        <p>
          Customer will pay Papermark or Customer’s reseller all applicable Fees
          in the currency and pursuant to the payment terms indicated on the
          Order Form or in the applicable agreement between Customer and
          Customer’s reseller. Customer authorizes Papermark, or Customer’s
          reseller, to charge Customer for all applicable Fees using Customer’s
          selected payment method, and Customer will issue the required
          purchasing documentation, if any. Fees are non-refundable except as
          required by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in the Terms.
        </p>
        <h3>6.2 Payment</h3>
        <p>
          Customer will pay Papermark invoices on the payment interval set forth
          in the Order Form. Papermark may suspend or terminate the Services if
          Fees are past due. Customer will provide complete and accurate billing
          and contact information to Papermark or to Customer’s reseller.
        </p>
        <h3>6.3 Taxes</h3>
        <p>
          Fees are exclusive of taxes and Customer is responsible for all Taxes.
          Papermark, or Customer’s reseller, will charge Taxes when required to
          do so. If Customer provides Papermark or its reseller with a valid
          exemption certificate, Papermark will not collect the taxes covered by
          that certificate.
        </p>
        <h3>6.4 Withholding Taxes</h3>
        <p>
          Customer will pay Papermark or its reseller net of any applicable
          Withholding Taxes. Customer and Papermark, or Customer’s reseller if
          applicable, will work together to avoid any Withholding Tax if
          exemptions, or a reduced treaty withholding rate, are available. If
          Papermark or Customer’s reseller qualifies for a tax exemption, or a
          reduced treaty withholding rate, Papermark or Customer’s reseller will
          provide Customer with reasonable documentary proof. Customer will
          provide Papermark or Customer’s reseller reasonable evidence that it
          has paid the relevant authority for the sum withheld or deducted.
        </p>
        <h3>6.5 Auto-renewals and Trials</h3>
        <p>
          IF CUSTOMER HAS ALREADY PROVIDED A PAYMENT METHOD TO PAPERMARK FOR
          RECURRING CHARGES AND CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT IS SET TO AUTO-RENEWAL OR IS
          IN A TRIAL PERIOD, PAPERMARK (OR CUSTOMER’S RESELLER) MAY CHARGE
          AUTOMATICALLY AT THE END OF THE TRIAL OR FOR THE RENEWAL, UNLESS
          CUSTOMER NOTIFIES PAPERMARK (OR CUSTOMER’S RESELLER, AS APPLICABLE)
          THAT CUSTOMER WANTS TO DISABLE AUTO-RENEWAL OR CANCEL THE SERVICES IN
          ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 7.2. Papermark may revise Services rates by
          providing the Customer at least thirty days’ notice prior to the next
          charge.
        </p>
        <h3>6.6 Purchase Orders</h3>
        <p>
          If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order
          number, Customer: (i) must provide the purchase order number at the
          time of purchase; and (ii) agrees that any terms and conditions on a
          Customer purchase order will not apply to these Terms and are null and
          void. If the Customer is purchasing via a reseller, any terms and
          conditions from the Customer’s reseller or in a purchase order between
          the Customer and its reseller that conflict with the Terms are null
          and void.
        </p>
        <h2>7. Subscription Services</h2>
        <h3>7.1 Services Term</h3>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise set forth on the Order Form, the Services are sold on
          a subscription basis. Papermark will deliver the Services to Customer
          for the Services Term. Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing,
          any increases in quantities of Services purchased during any Services
          Term will have a prorated term ending on the last day of the
          pre-existing Services Term.
        </p>
        <h3>7.2 Automatic Renewals</h3>
        <p>
          Unless otherwise specified on the Order Form and subject to Section
          6.5, following the Initial Services Term or a Renewal Term, Customer’s
          subscription to the Services will automatically renew for a Renewal
          Term at the then-current quantity, unless either party gives the other
          written notice of termination to the other (in the case of Customer,
          via email to support@papermark.io) at least thirty days prior to the
          expiration of the then-current Services Term for subscriptions less
          than one year and at least sixty days prior to the expiration of the
          then-current Services Term for subscriptions of one year or more. If
          Customer has purchased the Services online via a self-serve mechanism
          and provided a payment method to Papermark for recurring charges,
          Customer may elect to terminate the Terms via the Admin Console prior
          to the day a Renewal Term begins. Papermark reserves the right to
          change our prices for any renewal subscription.

          the remainder of the then-current Services Term based on Customer’s
          then-current price unless otherwise set forth on the Order Form.

        <h2>14. Disputes</h2>
        <h3>14.1 Informal Resolution</h3>
        <p>
          Before filing a claim, each party agrees to try to resolve the dispute
          by contacting the other party through the notice procedures in Section
          14.2. If a dispute is not resolved within sixty days of notice,
          Customer or Papermark may bring a formal proceeding.
        </p>
        <h3>14.2 Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          Customer and Papermark agree to resolve any claims relating to the
          Terms or the Services through final and binding individual
          arbitration, except as set forth below. This includes disputes arising
          out of or relating to the interpretation or application of this
          “Arbitration” subsection, including its scope, enforceability,
          revocability, or validity. The arbitration will be held in a location
          both parties agree to in writing. The arbitrator may award relief only
          individually and only to the extent necessary to redress Customer’s or
          Papermark’s individual claim(s); the arbitrator may not award relief
          on behalf of others or the general public. Our past, present and
          future affiliates and agents may invoke our rights under this
          “Disputes” Section in the event they become involved in a dispute with
          you; otherwise, these Terms do not give rights to any third parties.
        </p>
        <h3>14.3 Exception to Arbitration</h3>
        <p>
          Either party may bring a lawsuit in the federal or state courts of
          Munich, Germany solely for injunctive relief to stop unauthorized use
          or abuse of the Services or infringement of Intellectual Property
          Rights without first engaging in the informal dispute notice process
          described above. Both Customer and Papermark consent to venue and
          personal jurisdiction there.
        </p>
        <h3>14.4 NO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS</h3>
        <p>
          Customer may only resolve disputes with Papermark on an individual
          basis and may not bring a claim in a class, consolidated or
          representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private
          attorney general actions and consolidation with other arbitrations are
          not allowed.
        </p>
        <h3>14.5 Severability</h3>
        <p>
          If any part of this “Disputes” section is found to be illegal or
          unenforceable, the remainder will remain in effect, except that if a
          finding of partial illegality or unenforceability would allow class or
          representative arbitration, this “Disputes” section will be
          unenforceable in its entirety. If you are found to have a non-waivable
          right to bring a particular claim or to request a particular form of
          relief that the arbitrator lacks authority to redress or award
          according to this “Disputes” section, then only that respective claim
          or request for relief may be brought in court, and you and we agree
          that litigation of any such claim or request for relief shall be
          stayed pending the resolution of any individual claim(s) or request(s)
          for relief in arbitration.

          action, and Internet disturbance).

          invalid, that provision will be modified or eliminated to the minimum
          extent necessary so that these Terms will otherwise remain in full
          force and effect and enforceable; and an enforceable term will be
          substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible.

        <p>
          No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a
          result of these Terms and Customer does not have any authority of any
          kind to bind Papermark in any respect whatsoever; instead, our
          relationship is that of independent contractors.
